    <h2 class="hero_header">Intro to the DCM</h2>
    <p class="tagline">In the combat field, sharing information is critical to the success of a mission. Unfortunately, using phones and radios are a major risk due to their reliability of being intercepted. The drone control module is an alternative way to exchange information in the combat field with little to no risk of interception. This project is for the design of an expandable/ collapsible rapid mobile ground station that will be able to program a group 1 drone that will fly a small payload (USB/Hard drive) to a designated location. The drone will navigate its environment and should be able to avoid obstacles, then proceed to land at a designated area to deliver said payload. The control module must have low to no electromagnetic signature while the drone is in flight and is capable of manual control.</p>

   	  <p class="text_column"><strong>Two Flight Control Options:&nbsp;</strong>Our product can input data from the DCM by two paths to the drone to fly a UAV mission first via radio, and second USB cable. The mission is then uploaded to the flight controller into the drone allowing the drone to fly its pre-determined path autonomously. Manual Operation The second option is taking control of the drone via Radio Controller. </p>
<h2></h2>
    	<p class="text_column"><strong>Low EM Signature:&nbsp;</strong>During normal operation, the DCM communicates with the drone before take-off, uploading the selected waypoints and landing orders. The DCM operator then gives the command for the drone to take-off and fly its mission. Once the drone is headed to its first waypoint, the DCM communication can be severed completely, allowing the operators to limit their RF emissions, both in duration and in signal strength. At any time during flight, the operators can resume communications and take manual control of the drone. </p>

      <p>For this project, the drone  must fly autonomously. In order to accomplish this, we used an autopilot software called Ardupilot&nbsp; -&nbsp; Misson Planner. This software was used to build missions by mapping take-off points, waypoints to reach, and&nbsp; &nbsp;landing location. </p>
